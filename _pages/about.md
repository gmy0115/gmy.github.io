## Personal Introduction

Hello! I'm Mingyang Gao, a passionate student and researcher in the field of artificial intelligence and computer science. I am a 2022 undergraduate student majoring in Artificial Intelligence at the [School of Intelligence Science and Technology](https://ai.ustb.edu.cn/), University of Science and Technology Beijing ([USTB](https://www.ustb.edu.cn/)), supervised by Prof. [Wei He](https://ai.ustb.edu.cn/szdw/xsszmjs/H/74a32a50d6d74ae8b83f87be28b4bd3b.htm). Since September 2024, I have been conducting research internship at the [State Key Laboratory of Multimodal Artificial Intelligence Systems](https://mais.ia.ac.cn/), [Institute of Automation](https://ia.cas.cn/), Chinese Academy of Sciences, under the guidance of Associate Researcher [Xiaomei Zhang](http://www.ia.ac.cn/rcdw/fyjy/202409/t20240913_7362792.html).

## Education

- **2022.09 - Present** University of Science and Technology Beijing
  - Bachelor of Science in Artificial Intelligence
  - School of Intelligence Science and Technology
  - Expected Graduation: 2026

## Research Interests

My research interests span across several exciting areas in artificial intelligence:

- **Computer Vision**: Image processing, object detection, visual understanding systems, and computer vision applications
- **Multimodal Learning**: Integrating and processing information from multiple modalities (vision, language, audio) for comprehensive understanding
- **Large Language Models**: Research on foundation models, prompt engineering, and large-scale language model applications

## Technical Skills

- **Programming Languages**: C, C++, Python, Markdown
- **Machine Learning**: PyTorch, Scikit-learn
- **Data Analysis**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Tools & Platforms**: Git, Linux, Latex

## Current Focus

I am currently focused on **preparing for graduate school applications** while conducting research on **multimodal facial age estimation**. My research builds upon MaPLe (a follow-up work of CLIP) to leverage the rich semantic information in Visual-Language Models (VLMs) for downstream tasks like facial age estimation. I introduce cross-modal information fusion mechanisms and external knowledge (LLMs) guided reasoning to explore the applications of VLMs in facial age estimation.
